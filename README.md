# Algorithms-TraversingACell
Traversing a cell of numbers for the maximum total of numbers using dynamic programming.

Attempts to generate a route to find the maximum traversing from the top left to the bottom right. 
Tested using several randomly generated data sets.

Test Outputs:

Test 1:

Matrix:

5 2 1

2 8 9

2 0 2

Maximum cost to traverse = 26

Test 2:

Matrix:

0 1 0

9 1 8

5 8 1

Maximum cost to traverse = 23

Test 3:

Matrix:

6 1 8

1 2 5

5 4 6

Maximum cost to traverse = 26
