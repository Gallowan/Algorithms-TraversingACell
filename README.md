# Algorithms-TraversingACell
Traversing a cell of numbers for the maximum total of numbers using dynamic programming.

Attempts to generate a route to find the maximum traversing from the top left to the bottom right. 
Tested using several randomly generated data sets.

Test Outputs:

Test 1:
Matrix:
5 2 1
2 8 9
2 0 2
Maximum cost to traverse = 26

Test 2:
Matrix:
0 1 0
9 1 8
5 8 1
Maximum cost to traverse = 23

Test 3:
Matrix:
6 1 8
1 2 5
5 4 6
Maximum cost to traverse = 26
